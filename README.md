# graph-align

This repository contains the code for the following paper:
[Graph Algorithms for Multiparallel Word Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06283), To appear on EMNLP 2021.


We provide two methods to improve bilingual word alignments of a target language pair, exploiting signals from other languages in a multi-parallel corpus.
You can find the code for each method in its corresponding directory.
The obtain the calculated word alignments, the Gold-Standard word-alignment datasets, and other data used in the paper, check out the data directory.
